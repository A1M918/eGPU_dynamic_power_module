Hi, I have a workaround I am going to implement it very soon. which is, 
Buy 3 things, 
1 - solid state relay like this ( https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005943909513.html?spm=a2g0o.home.0.0.677a76dbAXPcDj&mp=1) 
Make sure it has enough Ampere rating, 
2 - A male and female of the power cord like this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004921974470.html?spm=a2g0o.home.0.0.677a76dbAXPcDj&mp=1
This is to intercept the power source with a Solid state relay to turn on and off. 
3 - A USB cable, we just need to use + and - wire for the power source, nothing else.


I have used this relay in my 3D printer and it works fine for me. So I thought why not use it with my eGPU? 
The idea is as soon as the PC is turned on, it supplies a 5V source into USB which will be enough to turn on the SSR which will enable the current flow of the main power source to eGPU.
